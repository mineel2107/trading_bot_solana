### Parallel Execution of New Transactions and Wallet Monitoring

This section explains how the parallel execution of new transactions and wallet monitoring takes place.

#### Wallet Selection Criteria

The wallet to be monitored from our selected transactions is chosen based on specific conditions that identify a wallet likely to make future purchases. The conditions are as follows:

- The wallet should be new, created less than 24 hours ago.
- It should have a low number of transactions.
- It should have never held any token other than our selected token.
- It should contain only one type of token.
- The SOL balance should meet a minimum expected threshold.

If a wallet meets these criteria, we proceed to buy some tokens.

#### Monitoring Process

The selected wallet is monitored for 15 minutes in parallel with the monitoring of live transactions for any interesting wallets. During this period:

- If a token sell occurs before the 15 minutes are up, we release the wallet from monitoring.
- If a token buy occurs within the 15 minutes, we sell the tokens we have acquired.

This approach ensures that we maximize our chances of profitable transactions while efficiently managing our resources.
